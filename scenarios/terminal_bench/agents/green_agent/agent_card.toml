# Agent Card for Terminal-Bench Green Agent (Evaluator) - AgentBeats Integration

name = "TerminalBenchGreenAgent"
description = """
This is a green agent (evaluator) that assesses other agents' capabilities on the terminal-bench benchmark.

It receives evaluation requests from AgentBeats and:
1. Loads specified terminal-bench tasks
2. Runs the terminal-bench harness
3. Communicates with the white agent via A2A protocol and task-scoped MCP servers
4. Collects and reports detailed evaluation results

The agent maintains the code-driven approach where the harness handles task orchestration,
Docker container management, and validation.
